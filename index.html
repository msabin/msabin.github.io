    <p>
        I am a Computer Scientist by training and a <a href="index.html#research">researcher</a>, <a href="https://github.com/msabin/">programmer</a>, and <a href="index.html#teaching">teacher</a>.  
    </p>

    <p>
        After focusing most heavily on teaching and theoretical research during my PhD
        at UC Berkeley (see my <a href="files/CV.pdf">CV</a> for my work in these
        roles), I am now putting much of my energy into reconnecting with
        programming.
    </p>

        <strong><a href="https://github.com/msabin/rhythmonics">Check out a recent music toy</a></strong> I've made to demonstrate
        the relationship between polyrhythms and harmony!

    <h2 id="research">Research </h2>

        <p>
            I have two main directions of research in Computer Science:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Mathematical Theory of Algorithms: Fine-grained Complexity Theory, 
                Pseudorandomness, Cryptography, Circuit Lower Bounds, and how these 
                all influence each other.
            </li>

            <li>
                Social Impacts of Algorithms: Interrogating the social impact of CS 
                research, such as Algorithmic “Fairness” and Machine Learning’s use 
                in the practice of Law, and the implicit values it often embeds.
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>
            I received my PhD at <a href="http://theory.cs.berkeley.edu">UC Berkeley</a> 
            in 2020 advised by <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/shafi/">Shafi Goldwasser</a>  and 
            <a href="https://engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/christos-papadimitriou">Christos Papadimitriou</a>, and
            I have spent past semesters visiting (chronologically) <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/">Ryan Williams</a> (MIT), 
            <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~russell/">Russell Impagliazzo</a> (UCSD), 
            <a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~andrejb/">Andrej Bogdanov</a> (CUHK), and 
            <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~alon/">Alon Rosen</a> (IDC Herzliya). Before all this, I spent much time in the Math 
            Lab at <a href="https://www.csus.edu">CSU Sacramento</a> receiving my BA in Mathematics and Applied Computing. See my 
            <a href="files/CV.pdf">CV</a> for more and see my <a href="files/research.pdf">Research Statement</a> for a more in-depth overview of my research directions.

    <h2 id="teaching">Teaching</h2>

        <p>
            I almost always have a teaching outlet for myself and am <em>currently</em> keeping teaching in my life by:

        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Substitute teaching with pre-schoolers at <a href="http://abundantbeginnings.org">forest</a> <a href="https://www.riceandbeanscoop.org"> schools </a> in Oakland in my free time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Teaching an introductory programming course in Python for international Latinx high schoolers with the <a href="https://www.eduexplora.com">EduExplora</a> program, starting in July '23.
            </li>
        </ul>

            
        <p>
            I have extensive experience across a wide range of age groups and levels of expertise and I have taught communities and topics ranging from elementary school aspiring scientists, to adolescent and adult dancers in Baile Folklórico, to graduate-level courses in Computer Science at UC Berkeley.
            To see my broad teaching and outreach experience see my <a href="files/CV.pdf">CV</a>.
        </p>




        <h3>  Philosophy </h3>
        <p>
        I try to not answer questions before students ask them.  Most of my teaching, then, is focused on guiding students towards asking those questions.  For math, for example, I do this with two main principles: </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Math is a social activity:  It is meant to be <i>fun</i>. Doing math is the only way to feel what math feels like, and so my teaching is example-driven to allow students to have their own "Aha!" moments and form their own conjectures.
            </li>
        
            <li>
                Math is a social activity:  It must be interactive and sensitive to students as people. The bulk of the the thinking should not be happening in my or any one student’s head, and most of my teaching focus is directed to asking:
                <em> Where is the thinking happening in the room?</em>
        
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        The techniques I use to realize these principles can be found in my <a href="files/teaching.pdf">Teaching Statement</a>, and the many forms of teaching I've engaged in can be found in my <a href="files/CV.pdf">CV</a>.
