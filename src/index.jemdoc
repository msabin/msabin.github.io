I am a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley, hosted by [http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sanjamg/ Sanjam Garg].\n\n

I am interested in Complexity Theory, Cryptography, and especially the things inbetween.\n\n

I used to be a fifth-year graduate student at MIT, where I was advised by [https://people.csail.mit.edu/vinodv/ Vinod Vaikuntanathan]. I have spent past summers visiting [http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~alon/ Alon Rosen], [https://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~bennyap/ Benny Applebaum], and [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~andrejb/ Andrej Bogdanov] in their respective domains. Before all this, I did a B.Tech. in [http://cse.iitm.ac.in/ Computer Science] at [https://www.iitm.ac.in/ IIT Madras], where I was advised by [http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~jayalal/ Jayalal Sarma].\n\n

If you wish to know more, my CV is [files/prashant_cv.pdf here].
