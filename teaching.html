I try to not answer questions before students ask them.  Most of my teaching, then, is focused on guiding students towards asking those questions.  I do this with two main principles: <br /> <br /></p>

<p>– Math is a social activity:  It is meant to be <i>fun</i>. Doing math is the only way to feel what math feels like, and so my teaching is example-driven to allow students to have their own "Aha!" moments and form their own conjectures.
<br /> <br />

– Math is a social activity:  It must be interactive and sensitive to students as people.
The bulk of the the thinking should not be happening in my or any one student’s head, and most of my teaching focus is directed to asking:<br /> <i> Where is the thinking happening in the room?</i>

<br /><br /></p>

The techniques I use to realize these principles can be found in my <a href="files/teaching.pdf">Teaching Philosophy</a>, and the many forms of teaching I've engaged in can be found in my <a href="files/CV.pdf">CV</a>.
